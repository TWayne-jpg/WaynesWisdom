### Hey. Wayne Here. ###

**Welcome to my corner of the internet.**

I am a Permaculture crew leader. However my big dreams and aspirations lie far beyond my simple 9-5. I aim to become the biggest leader within the self improvement space.

This website gives you access to all required readings, required viewings, courses on fitness, meditation, etc. This is meant for men looking for guidance and education on how to live a purposeful life.

I strive to lead, teach and work alongside my followers as they work to become the strongest men possible, building the 6 foundational pillars for a disciplined and purposeful life.

If this interests you, I encourage you to follow me on Youtube, so as to learn from my mistakes and victories, as well as to work with each other to survive this decaying world together. 

See you on the objective.
